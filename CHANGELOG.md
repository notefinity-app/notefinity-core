## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added

- **ðŸ”’ END-TO-END ENCRYPTION SUPPORT**: Major privacy feature implementation

  - **Zero-knowledge server architecture** - Only encrypted blobs stored server-side
  - **Complete data transparency** - All server operations are auditable
  - **Optional collaboration features** - Public key registry for encrypted sharing
  - **Mixed content support** - Encrypted and unencrypted pages can coexist
  - **Full backward compatibility** - Existing unencrypted pages remain accessible

- **New Data Structures**:

  - `EncryptedBlob` interface for opaque encrypted data storage
  - Extended `Page` interface with encryption fields (`isEncrypted`, `encryptedContent`, `encryptedTitle`)
  - `UserPublicKey` interface for collaboration key registry
  - Enhanced database schemas with encryption support

- **Public Key Registry API** (`/api/keys/*`):

  - `POST /api/keys/store-public-key` - Store user's public key for collaboration
  - `GET /api/keys/public-key/:userId` - Retrieve another user's public key
  - `GET /api/keys/my-public-key` - Get own public key information
  - `DELETE /api/keys/my-public-key` - Remove public key from registry

- **Enhanced Pages API**: All existing `/api/pages/*` endpoints now support encrypted content

  - Automatic detection of encrypted vs unencrypted content
  - Proper validation schemas for both content types
  - Consistent API response serialization with encryption fields

- **Database Enhancements**:

  - New `notefinity_keystores` database for public key registry
  - Enhanced indexes for encrypted data operations
  - Keystore operations (create, read, update, delete public keys)
  - User isolation for all keystore operations

- **Comprehensive Documentation**:

  - `E2E_ENCRYPTION.md` - Complete implementation and usage guide
  - Client-side integration examples with Web Crypto API
  - Security architecture documentation
  - Migration strategy for existing users

- **Extensive Testing**: Added 6 new encryption tests (32 total tests)
  - Encrypted page storage and retrieval
  - Public key registry operations
  - Server transparency verification
  - Mixed encrypted/unencrypted scenarios

### Security

- **Ultimate Privacy Assurance**: Even if Notefinity servers are compromised, user data remains secure
- **No server-side decryption capability** - Server cannot access plaintext content under any circumstances
- **Private key protection** - Private keys never transmitted to or stored on server
- **Auditable operations** - All server code is transparent and verifiable
- **Zero data leakage** - Server only handles opaque encrypted blobs

### Changed

- Enhanced all API response serialization to include encryption metadata when present
- Updated validation schemas to handle encrypted content fields
- Refactored page serialization with helper functions for consistency

## Development Notes

This release establishes the foundation for a completely transparent, privacy-focused knowledge management backend. Every operation is auditable, user data is isolated by design, and premium features are added through the same transparent plugin system.

The codebase serves as proof that Notefinity cannot access user data inappropriately - all operations are visible and verifiable through this open-source implementation.
