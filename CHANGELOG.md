## Development Notes

This release establishes the foundation for a completely transparent, privacy-focused knowledge management backend. Every operation is auditable, user data is isolated by design, and premium features are added through the same transparent plugin system.

The codebase serves as proof that Notefinity cannot access user data inappropriately - all operations are visible and verifiable through this open-source implementation.
